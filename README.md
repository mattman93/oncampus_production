I wish to create a social simulation free of systemic hierarchical social structure,
 a breeding ground for true interaction unbiased by the idiosyncratic and arbitrary 
 pretense that dictates the order of real life social interactions 
 .. A place to facilitate the anonymous exchange of ideas and beliefs 
 without the judgmental eyes of our peers ........ www.oncampus.ws
